My end of cycle project of FP in Multiplatform Applications Design.

"De la huerta a la mesa" a tool used to display fruits and vegetables that are in season.

I hope that this application written in java and designed for android will be useful to people.

I include the installation manual, the user manual and the executable of the application.

Thank you.
